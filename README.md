This game is based off of two gangs from the Red Dead Redemption 2 universe, the O'Driscolls, and the Lemoyne Raiders. 
The player gets to decide whether or not they want to play as a O'Driscoll or Raider.
As they play, the players get to make decisions such as either robbing people, or letting them go, or if they want to stay loyal to their gang or cut free and run to the cops.
They also get to participate in small mini games such as cracking a safe, using not so subtle clues. They also get to build up an inventory throughout the game.
The choices that the players make will determine what ending they get, with for endings each for each gang.
